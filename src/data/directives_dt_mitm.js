Program is unable to proceed properly”</strong> is detected (in Stage 1), the directive shall check if there are two more occurrences within in the next minute (Stage 2). If this is followed by one occurrence of the Event Type <strong>“Internal ENIP tag (SENSOR 3) updated”</strong> (in Stage 3) within in the next minute the alarm is set off."+
